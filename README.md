Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Shalini — a data enthusiast who thrives on transforming raw datasets into meaningful insights and interactive stories. Whether it's debugging a stubborn pipeline or designing a dashboard that speaks for itself, I bring persistence, precision, and creativity to every challenge.

## 🔍 What I Do
- Clean, wrangle, and analyze real-world data using **Python**, **pandas**, and **scikit-learn**
- Build and troubleshoot **machine learning workflows** for practical applications
- Design **interactive dashboards** in **Power BI** and **Python** to make data accessible
- Apply statistical thinking and visual storytelling to uncover patterns and drive decisions

## 🧠 What I Value
- **Clarity** in communication, **depth** in analysis, and **resilience** in problem-solving
- A growth mindset — every bug is a lesson, every dataset a new adventure
- Making technical concepts **engaging and accessible** through creative presentations

## 📊 Featured Projects
